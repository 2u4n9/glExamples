# glExamples

This repository contains some OpenGL examples.
These examples have been written in C++ and use OpenGL 3.3.

Each example resides in its own folder. Code that is often reused, such as
code for compiling and linking shader programs, is put into a seperate folder and reused in the different examples.

This code has been written with OS X as a target. No special care has been
taken to make sure the code is cross-platform. While the examples might
not compile out of the box on your machine, the code can still be reused in
your projects. You should be able to just plug it into an OpenGL application
that compiles and runs on your machine.
